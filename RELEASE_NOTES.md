### Release Notes

#### Breaking Changes

##### Extension kits replace Bundles

The Bundle surface is gone. Extensions are now the single packaging unit, and installing one is inert: it publishes no tools and no resources until you explicitly enable it. Before enabling, you can preview exactly what an extension would publish and inspect what it is publishing right now, and any extension that declares network access must have its network requirement digest confirmed by a person. (#291)

- `compozy extension preview <name>` shows what enabling would publish without changing state; `compozy extension inventory <name>` shows the live published inventory. Agents get the same reads through `compozy__extensions_preview` and `compozy__extensions_inventory`.
- `compozy extension enable|disable|update|install` accept `--confirm-network-requirement <digest>`, so a network-declaring extension cannot start publishing without an explicit confirmation recorded on the install.
- `compozy extension secrets set|bind|list|unset` manages write-only environment bindings that are scoped per workspace and stored as secret references, never as values.
- Marketplace kinds are now exactly `extension`, `mcp`, and `skill`.

Migration notes: the whole `compozy bundle` command group is removed (`catalog`, `preview`, `activate`, `list`, `get`, `deactivate`, `network-settings`), along with the `compozy__bundles_*` native tools, the `compozy__bundles` toolset, the `bundle` marketplace kind, and the Bundle API surfaces. There is no alias — rebuild bundle-shaped setups as extensions and enable them explicitly.

##### Runtime hardening and secret-safe provider login

A broad modernization pass across the Go runtime tightened lifecycle and cleanup ownership, ID allocation, task settlement, filesystem confinement, and streaming framing. Most of it is invisible, but it lands several deliberate cuts that change what operators, scripts, and agents see. (#293)

- `providers.<id>.auth_login_command` is now write-only. You can still set it through `config.toml`, `compozy config set`, or `compozy__config_set`, but no read surface returns it. `compozy config show|list|get|diff`, provider status, doctor, Settings, HTTP, and UDS return a safe `login` descriptor instead: whether it is configured, its source, the executable basename, whether that executable is present, and a recommended action.
- Every per-session event database carries an immutable owner and physical identity. A database that was copied between sessions or workspaces is refused before any migration or mutation — no adoption, no rebinding, no automatic repair. The operator recovery path is documented under "Session event store ownership".
- Markdown files under `<workspace>/knowledge/` are injected as a bounded workspace knowledge snapshot before each accepted turn, including task, task-creator, and Heartbeat wakes. It is prompt context for the turn, not durable memory.
- Installing an extension from Git now requires Git 2.37 or newer and reports `extension_git_version_unsupported` when it is older. Git sources must be HTTPS and resolve to public addresses.

Migration notes: `compozy provider auth login --print-command` is removed. The config key `memory.recall.signals.metrics_enabled` is removed with no alias. The task-notification native tools take `workspace_id` instead of `workspace`, and the old input is not an alias. Notification cursor identity and `delivery_id` are now opaque values that must be echoed back byte for byte.

##### implement-tasks replaces the software-delivery Loop

The bundled dev-cycle Loop now does one job clearly: implement authored task files in dependency order. `software-delivery` is gone and `implement-tasks` takes its place, with a five-node graph — `slug_input → load_tasks → implement → execute_task → collect` — and only three inputs. The old second control layer for review, command verification, and human approval is removed from the bundled Loop; task-level validation, self-review, tracking updates, and optional per-task commits stay inside the implementation agent's own prompt. (#325)

- Inputs are now `slug`, `implementer`, and `auto_commit`. The `review`, `verify`, and `approve` nodes and their edges are deleted, along with the verification contract, stale hash fields, and target-branch handling.
- The separate bundled `review-and-fix` Loop is unchanged, and custom Loops can still declare their own command gates — `verify_command` remains part of the generic Loop DSL.
- The catalog, Loop overview, configuration examples, migration guide, web routes, and the official CompozyOS skill all name `implement-tasks`.

Migration notes: this is a hard cut with no alias. Any config, CLI or API call, automation binding, or documentation link that says `software-delivery` must say `implement-tasks`, and the `target_branch` and `verify_command` inputs must be dropped from `[loops.inputs.*]`.

```toml
# before
[loops.inputs.software-delivery]
target_branch = "main"
verify_command = "make gate"
auto_commit = false

# after
[loops.inputs.implement-tasks]
auto_commit = false
```

##### One task-delivery Loop with two execution modes

`implement-tasks` now owns both task-delivery paths. Its default `per-task` mode keeps one isolated `code_implementer` session per task; `mode=orchestrated` uses the bundled `orchestrator` agent to spawn, prompt, verify, and stop one bounded worker per task.

- Four optional runtime inputs choose the conductor, backend workers, frontend workers, and every other worker. Task-frontmatter runtime fields still win over these run inputs.
- `compozy spawn` now accepts provider, model, reasoning-effort, and speed overrides, so orchestrated workers preserve the complete runtime choice.
- Goal output contracts now require the runtime's `complete|blocked` vocabulary, and Goal prompts receive the authored output schema.
- The standalone `orchestrate-tasks` Loop and its docs/catalog entry are removed. Operator-side `[loops.inputs.orchestrate-tasks]` config blocks are now inert and should be deleted; move any desired values under `[loops.inputs.implement-tasks]` and set `mode = "orchestrated"`.

##### The desktop app is now Electron

The Tauri/Rust desktop host is replaced by an Electron shell with a narrow preload boundary, and updating became one durable daemon-owned operation exposed identically through the CLI, HTTP, UDS, Settings, and the menubar. The app provisions the bundled daemon from an empty home, or attaches to a compatible daemon that is already running without taking ownership of it, keeping single-instance focus, deep links, safe navigation boundaries, page zoom, window geometry recovery, diagnostics, logs, and the owned-versus-attached quit contract. (#424)

- Runtime and App are separate update tracks with operation progress, holder-aware blocked state, staged-next-launch state, apply and cancel actions, and truthful absence when a track is unsupported.
- A keyboard-accessible menubar indicator appears only when an update is actionable and navigates to Settings. The renderer holds no desktop-only update authority, and the SPA behaves the same in a browser and in the app.
- Desktop artifacts are planned, inventoried, and channel-checked as one release authority, with notarization and signing input checks and packaged smokes provisioned from empty isolated homes. On macOS the ZIP and on Linux the AppImage are the updater artifacts; DMG and DEB are install artifacts only.

Migration notes: this is a hard cut with no compatibility bridge. The Tauri runtime, commands, permissions, capabilities, fixtures, generated bindings, Cargo dependencies, build configuration, scripts, config keys, docs, and tests are deleted rather than deprecated. Install the app from the artifacts published with this release. The installed-app update walk from one beta to the next was not verified for this build, so the App track must be proven by a release owner across a fresh beta pair before it is treated as delivered.

##### The OS Release

CompozyOS v0.3 is a new operating system boundary for agent work. Sessions, tasks, loops, memory,
permissions, automation, the OS shell, and Compozy Network now share one daemon-owned state model.
People can start and inspect that work from the web, CLI, HTTP/SSE, or UDS. Agents can operate the
same runtime through structured tools and extension contracts.

This is a breaking beta. The command, package, environment, storage, API, and tool namespaces move
to CompozyOS, and several v0.2 surfaces have deliberate replacements or removals. Follow the
[v0.3 migration guide](https://compozy.com/runtime/migration/) before replacing an existing install.
The maintained v0.2 line and its collateral remain on `legacy/v0.2`.

Install the beta through the verified hosted installer, `@compozy/cli@beta`, or the explicit
`github.com/compozy/compozy@v0.3.0-beta.1` Go version. The beta channel may change before v0.3.0
stable; production rollouts should pin the version and review each prerelease.

The repository was already MIT licensed. v0.3 corrects stale BSL-1.1 text in distribution metadata;
it does not relicense the code.

#### Features

##### Agent Plugins install as extensions

CompozyOS ingests [Agent Plugins 1.0.0](https://agent-plugins.org/) packages as extensions with no product-specific manifest. A portable plugin contributes skills plus local or remote MCP servers while keeping the existing extension lifecycle, trust, isolation, diagnostics, Marketplace, CLI, HTTP, UDS, native-tool, and Web management surfaces. (#419)

- Manifest discovery and validation are strict: fixed-location skills and MCP configuration, closed schemas, deterministic diagnostics, native-manifest precedence, and safe rejection of unsupported components.
- Portable skills and stdio or streamable-HTTP MCP servers are synthesized into the canonical extension model, with absolute `PLUGIN_ROOT` and `PLUGIN_DATA` expansion, single-token stdio commands, package-root working directories, remote-header bindings, URL policy, and secret redaction.

Migration notes: end-to-end delivery is claimed only for the provider paths proven end to end, Claude Code and Hermes. OpenClaw's current ACP bridge advertises `session_mcp=false`, so CompozyOS fails closed instead of pretending to deliver session MCP servers.

##### Agents operate commands without the UI

Everything the palette does is reachable from the CLI, HTTP, UDS, and native tools, with the same reasons and the same gates. An agent supervising CompozyOS discovers a command, checks its contract, targets a client, invokes it, and follows the approval — never depending on a browser. (#441)

- Native tools: `compozy__cmd_palette_list` reads the daemon-canonical catalog for the bound workspace, and `compozy__cmd_palette_invoke` runs one command with `id`, optional `args`, and optional `client`. Availability, targeting, single-flight, and approval rules all still apply.
- Every refusal is structured and carries the same text the UI row shows: `command_not_found`, `invalid_arguments` naming the fields, `no_attached_shell`, `multiple_clients` listing every attachment ID, and `already_running`.
- HTTP and UDS expose the catalog, clients, invocation, and stream under `/api/cmd-palette/*`, plus rank signals, usage, pins, and personalization. Approvals are read and canceled through `/api/tools/approvals/{id}`.
- Configuration parity is complete: bindings, aliases, pins, and personalization resets go through the same validated daemon paths Settings uses, and a change made by an agent reaches connected shells without a restart.
- `compozy approvals show|cancel` is a new top-level verb for the tool-approval lifecycle behind any invocation.

```bash
compozy cmd-palette invoke session.new --client <attachment-id> -o json
compozy cmd-palette invoke <destructive-id> -o json   # returns approval_pending + approval_id
compozy approvals show <approval-id> -o json          # pending → terminal
compozy approvals cancel <approval-id>
```

##### Ask the agent when nothing matches

A query with no strong result no longer dead-ends. The palette offers one visually distinct `Ask agent: '<query>'` row; pressing Enter creates a session with the workspace's default agent and uses the query as the opening prompt. (#441)

- Nothing is sent before Enter. Typing never carries the query to a provider, and a rapid double Enter still creates exactly one session.
- A weak-but-real match keeps both the results and the fallback row; only a query below the served threshold is fallback-only.
- With no workspace default agent, Enter opens the agent picker first. If the session fails to start, the failure names its reason and the palette reopens with your query intact.
- Turn it off in Settings → Palette, or set `fallback_targets = []`. Both report the same desired state, and the row disappears immediately.

```toml
[cmd_palette]
# The current runtime accepts "agent". Use [] to disable the fallback row.
fallback_targets = ["agent"]
```

##### Attention: know which session needs you

CompozyOS has one daemon-owned attention model. Pending input, permission requests, finished-unseen sessions, operator presence, notification delivery, and cross-workspace session discovery are runtime state instead of per-surface guesses. Orchestrator agents get structured wait, spawn, stop, approve, clarify-answer, prompt-cancel, and notify controls across native tools, CLI, HTTP, and UDS, so an agent supervising other agents no longer polls a shell or depends on the web UI to act. (#422)

- The global catalog persists canonical attention revisions, pending interactions, seen and settled state, and cursor-stable attention ordering.
- Presence leases, attention summaries and events, sanitized interaction discovery, generalized waits, prompt cancellation, operator notifications, and session wake propagation are available on every transport, with deterministic CLI exit behavior.
- Desktop shortcuts moved to a daemon-owned, configurable keymap, and the command palette gained nested views including an attention-first Sessions view.

##### Batuta in the Marketplace

Batuta v0.1.0-beta.3 ships as a curated community extension, so operators discover and install it from the Marketplace instead of going through the unverified GitHub-install consent flow. (#432)

- Its agent, skill, and Loop are resource-only and vendored for review, pinned to a deterministic archive digest.
- It installs from the `community` tier and still requires explicit enablement before it publishes its resources.

##### Bundled Tailscale connectivity extension

Gateway reachability ships with a first-party provider. The `tailscale` extension runs a Tailscale
node inside the CompozyOS process through `tsnet`, against the operator's own account — nothing else
to install, and CompozyOS operates no relay, server, or account on anyone's behalf. The private tier
serves `https://compozy-gateway.<tailnet>.ts.net:8443` on the tailnet; the public tier serves the
same hostname over Tailscale Funnel on 443. (#331)

- Bind the auth key once with `compozy extension secrets set tailscale --env TS_AUTHKEY` (hidden
  input); the value never appears in output, status, or diagnostics.
- The extension declares required Live network participation for `gateway.private` and
  `gateway.public`, so enabling asks for a one-time digest confirmation — and asks again only when
  that declaration changes.
- First activation provisions the HTTPS certificate before the Funnel listener opens, verifies
  public endpoints through authenticated DNS-over-TLS (`gateway.verify.public_dns_resolver`), and
  keeps unverified listeners staged with bounded retries instead of tearing them down.
- Third-party providers implement the same `connectivity.provider` contract from the Go and
  TypeScript SDKs, gated by install-source trust and control-digest re-confirmation on every enable
  and boot.

##### Complete Loop node lifecycle

Loops now have a full declarative failure contract at the node level and precise repair controls at the operator level. Authors classify failures, declare retries with backoff, route errors, absorb them with `allow_fail`, set attempt timeouts and deadlines, emit `on_*` effects, and add durable wait nodes. Operators pause, resume, cancel, kill, or requeue individual nodes and list what is waiting, quarantined, retrying, or asking for attention — all from the CLI, HTTP, UDS, native tools, and MCP, without opening the web UI. (#305)

- `compozy loop cancel` drains a run safely and `compozy loop kill` closes it immediately; `compozy loop node pause|resume|cancel|kill|requeue` repairs a single node, and `compozy loop nodes --state waiting|quarantined|attention|retrying` inventories a run.
- Agents get the same controls through `compozy__loop_cancel`, `compozy__loop_kill`, `compozy__loop_node_pause`, `compozy__loop_node_resume`, `compozy__loop_node_cancel`, `compozy__loop_node_kill`, `compozy__loop_node_requeue`, and `compozy__loop_nodes`; `compozy__loop_status` now reports node lifecycle state.
- Repeated failure on one node quarantines that node instead of terminating the run, so independent lanes keep working, and the failure cause is classified rather than matched from a magic string.
- Long-running Loop-bound sessions are no longer killed on elapsed time. Liveness is judged from real evidence, and prolonged silence raises attention instead of ending the work.
- Defaults are tunable through `loops.defaults.delivery.*`, `loops.defaults.watch.*`, and `loops.breaker.*`, and new blocking lint rules reject invalid routes, impossible timing, malformed effects and waits, and watch sources without a stable identity.

Migration notes: `compozy loop stop` is deleted — the CLI verb, the HTTP route, and the `compozy__loop_stop` native tool. Choose `cancel` or `kill` explicitly. Extension watch sources must now declare `event_key`; a source without a stable event identity is rejected before a run starts.

##### Correct one output, repair one lane

Operators can fix a settled node output without rewriting what actually happened, and can act on a single fan-out cell without disturbing its siblings. (#427)

- **Amend output** applies to a settled output while its run, node, or cell is parked, and appears only when the node declares an output shape to validate against. It shows the recorded original read-only beside the corrected value and takes a reason.
- Amendments are append-only: the recorded output is never rewritten, the corrected value becomes what resume and downstream reads see, and both stay visible in history and in a diff. Amending does not re-run consumers — pair it with **Rerun from here**.
- Run detail returns `amendments[]` with bounded, redacted values, or a byte-size and content-hash summary for large data. No API reads an amendment's private output reference directly.
- The control is available as `compozy loop node amend`, `POST /loop-runs/:id/nodes/:node/amend`, and `compozy__loop_node_amend`.
- `--item` (or `item_index`) pauses, resumes, cancels, or kills one fan-out cell without touching the rest of the window.

```bash
compozy loop node amend --run-id <run-id> --node build --item 3 \
  --payload '{"artifact":"dist/app-1.4.2.tgz"}' --reason "wrong tag captured"
```

##### Cursor models come from your account

Cursor used to look curated in CompozyOS but was not truthful to the account that was signed in: a small hand-written list stood in for the real catalog and, worse, acted as an allowlist that rejected valid model ids before Cursor ever saw them. CompozyOS now reads the account catalog from `cursor-agent models` before a session exists, and exact provider model ids are forwarded unchanged. (#320)

- The first catalog read bootstraps Cursor discovery once and persists the outcome; later reads serve the cache, and explicit refresh is the refresh boundary. In the QA account this surfaced 193 real models, including `composer-2.5`.
- Only `id - display name` rows are parsed. Headings, tips, duplicates, and empty output can never become invented models.
- Curated data is metadata again, not membership policy. Sessions and Loops accept ids like `cursor/composer-2.5`, and an unknown _provider_ still fails with a structured `unknown_provider` error.
- `providers.<id>.models.discovery` applies live — no daemon restart. A provider outage records the failure and keeps the rows you already have; disabling discovery clears them and records `disabled`.
- In the web runtime selector, "Use an exact custom model ID…" now opens a dedicated field: empty input cannot be committed, typing turns the action into `Use "<id>"`, Enter and click both commit, and closing returns to normal catalog search.
- Cursor keeps the operator `HOME` its `native_cli` login contract expects.

Migration notes: the curated Cursor allowlist and its session preflight are deleted with no compatibility bridge. If a provider rejects an id, that provider's error is now the authority.

##### Every domain opens inside the palette

The palette is not only a launcher — it browses. Sessions, Tasks, Loops, Jobs, Agents, Triggers, Marketplace, Bridges, Knowledge, Vault, Worktrees, Network channels, and Extensions each open as a view without leaving the overlay, and views stack so one selection can push the next. (#441)

- Four view kinds ship: **list**, **detail**, **grid**, and **form**. Lists carry domain chips with truthful counts and single-select semantics; a chip with zero matches names the filter and clears in one keystroke.
- State badges come from the shared status vocabulary and always pair a glyph with a label — never color alone.
- Selecting a row previews its metadata and sanitized text in a detail pane without stealing focus from the list, and the pane clears when the row disappears from another surface instead of showing stale content.
- Form views traverse typed fields in declared order, block an invalid submit on the first failing field, and discard values when you pop the view.
- Vault rows show names and metadata only. A secret value never enters a view, a preview, or a match highlight.
- A cold open shows a loading state, never a blank list dressed up as empty; an oversized list either scrolls virtually or states the exact `showing N of M`.
- Views stream patches, so a list already on screen updates in place as the runtime changes.

```bash
compozy cmd-palette list --source core -o json | grep palette.view.
# palette.view.sessions, .tasks, .loops, .jobs, .agents, .triggers,
# .marketplace, .bridges, .knowledge, .vault, .worktrees,
# .network-channels, .extensions
```

##### Extensions contribute commands and views

An extension can add its own commands and views to the palette from `resources.cmd_palette`, beside its tools. CompozyOS validates the contribution during `extension build`, `extension validate`, install, and development reload, and prefixes every local ID with the extension name — `capture` from the `notes` extension becomes `ext.notes.capture`. (#441)

- The action union is closed: `tool` calls a tool the same extension owns, `view` opens one of its views, `navigate` opens a CompozyOS app, and `url` opens an external link. Extensions cannot declare client operations.
- A declarative view names a **read-only** tool as its source and returns the shared `v1` view payload, which the daemon validates before rendering. A mutating, destructive, interactive, or open-world tool is rejected at validation time, so opening a view never starts an approval flow.
- A programmable view sets `program: true` and is backed by the public `view.provider` surface, with patch streaming for live updates. Start from the template with `compozy extension init notes --template view-provider-ts`.
- A command can ship a `default_shortcut`. If that chord already belongs to something else, the default stays dormant and the conflict is visible in Settings instead of silently stealing the key.
- Destructive extension commands must declare themselves and supply confirmation copy; the same approval gates apply to them as to core commands.

```ts
resources: {
  cmd_palette: {
    commands: [{
      id: "capture",
      title: "Capture note",
      section: "Notes",
      icon: "pencil",
      action: { kind: "tool", tool: "capture_note" },
      default_shortcut: "alt+shift+KeyN",
    }],
    views: [{
      id: "recent",
      title: "Recent notes",
      kind: "list",
      source: { tool: "list_recent" },
    }],
  },
},
```

##### Fan-out settles with an honest count

A fan-out can declare how it settles, and a partial result stays partial everywhere it is read instead of being rounded up to success or down to failure. (#427)

- `strategy` accepts `wait_all` (the default), `fail_fast`, `race`, and `best_effort`. `best_effort` requires both a threshold — a percentage like `66%` or a count like `{ count: 2 }` — and an explicit `missing: acceptable`.
- A collect result is `succeeded`, `partial`, or `failed`, and its output carries `total`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `canceled`, `coverage_rate`, and `partial`.
- Live counts read through `nodes.<fan-out-id>.progress.*` — `total`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `canceled`, `running`, `pending`, `settled`, `success_rate`, `failure_rate` — with the short `progress.*` form inside the fan-out body. Rates are `0` for an empty collection.
- The run page separates lanes that succeeded, lanes that failed, lanes the strategy canceled, and lanes that never materialized because the window did not open them. Partiality is a run-level fact (`completion_state`), so it reads `partial` in the outcome card, the run lists, and a diff. A wide fan-out reports aggregate counts instead of one row per lane.
- The fan-out window has no daemon-wide ceiling; logical width stays bounded by each node's positive `max_fan_out`. Write-time validation rejects a negative `fan_out_width`.

```yaml
- id: inspect_files
  class: control
  kind: fan-out
  collection: "{{ .nodes.changed.output.files }}"
  bind_as: file
  strategy:
    kind: best_effort
    threshold: 66%
    missing: acceptable
```

##### First-class Git worktrees

Git worktrees are runtime objects across the daemon, Web desktop, CLI, HTTP and UDS, native tools, extensions, configuration, generated contracts, and documentation: create, adopt, discover, inspect, reconcile, dismiss, and safely remove isolated checkouts. Sessions, Task runs, fan-out workers, and Loop environments bind to an exact worktree without losing the parent workspace's config, skills, agents, or memory. (#388, #410)

- The new worktree domain owns Git capability detection, canonical repository identity, naming and placement, per-repository mutation locking, and durable lifecycle state.
- Creation is a phased `pending → ready` operation with recorded ownership checkpoints, bootstrap copy and setup support, cancel-safe rollback, and boot recovery.
- Adoption verifies the linked checkout, the common Git directory, main-checkout exclusion, and repository identity before registering it. Discovery merges Git-known checkouts with durable records without turning a discovered row into an adopted worktree.
- Removal fences the record as removing, rechecks session activity and Git safety under the repository lock, preserves branches and history, and requires an explicit second step for dirty or unique-unpushed work.
- Finishing work runs through a truthful assisted-exit ladder for commit, push, pull request, merged evidence, and cleanup. Dismissed tombstones release their reserved name, exit actions resolve caller references to canonical record ids, and CLI mutation output keeps worktree identity.

##### Grouped skill directories

CompozyOS now discovers `SKILL.md` definitions at any depth below each skill root, so teams can organize capabilities under folders such as `marketing/content/` without changing frontmatter identity or normal precedence. `compozy skill create <name> --group <relative/path>` now scaffolds grouped workspace skills safely.

##### Keep sessions alive while observable work is still running

Session supervision now considers agent progress, running tools, active children, Loop runs, task leases, and scheduled waits. A quiet transcript alone no longer means the session is idle. If a work-signal source cannot answer, supervision reports attention and suspends automatic stopping.

Observed silence warns after 30 minutes by default and enters the normal stop ladder after another 10 minutes; fresh work cancels the pending stop. Network Live participation has no aggregate wall-time limit by default, while explicitly configured and other budgets remain effective.

Capacity starvation now escalates visibly. Blocked automation fires defer durably and resume after restart, and scheduler counters distinguish skipped wakes from successful work.

PR: [#557](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/557).

##### Feedback semantics for durable Loops

A rejected Loop generation no longer restarts blind. The rejection is carried into the next attempt as context, only the producers responsible for it are re-run, and an opt-in ratchet keeps the best-scoring generation instead of losing it to a later regression. Every generation now records its origin, its parent, the gate verdict, the score, and the blocking issues inside claim-fenced transactions, so the CLI, HTTP, UDS, native tools, SSE, and the web UI all read the same durable run truth. (#290)

- Loop templates can read `previous.*` (including `previous.generation` and `previous.route_causes`) and `best.*` to steer the next attempt from what actually failed.
- Metric gates take a direction — `maximize` or `minimize` — plus a `min_delta` improvement threshold, so a regression is rejected deterministically. Invalid thresholds fail authoring with `metric_min_delta_invalid`.
- `compozy__loop_status` and `compozy__loop_runs` project score, best generation, gate verdict, and generation origin and parentage; run detail, catalog, and recent-runs views render the same fields.
- `compozy extension list` and `compozy extension status` accept `--workspace`, so agents can inspect workspace dev overlays without dropping to raw HTTP.

Migration notes: this is a greenfield hard cut that discards existing Loop run history. The migration clears Loop runs, run events, gate decisions, generation outputs, goal turns and checkpoints, session bindings, and output blobs, along with the task and automation runs that referenced them. Export anything you need before upgrading.

##### Loop inputs that know what they point at

A Loop input can declare the kind of thing it accepts, and every surface that edits inputs now validates against the real workspace catalog before anything starts. A wrong agent name, a retired skill, or an unsupported model is caught at the field that caused it instead of failing deep inside a run. (#427, #438)

- New input types: `agent` (an exact agent name), `ref` with a closed `ref.kind` of `skill`, `loop`, `worktree`, `session`, `workspace`, or `secret`, and `runtime` (`{ provider?, model?, reasoning? }`, accepting exact custom model IDs). A string-like input may still declare `enum`, and those choices take precedence over a catalog picker.
- Effective values resolve one field at a time: run input, then workspace config, then global config, then the definition default. The daemon validates the winning value immediately before a dry run or a run, including entity existence and runtime support.
- A failure starts no run, creates no task and no external action, and returns the same `input_validation` payload — `{ loop, field, kind?, value?, origin, reason }` — over HTTP, UDS, CLI, native tools, and the web form, which attaches the reason to that field.
- The same typed controls appear wherever Loop inputs are edited: the run form, scheduled automation, event-trigger mappings, fork and amend flows, and human-request answers annotated with `x-compozy-kind`. Every surface submits the exact stored identifier — a display label is never treated as a reference.
- The run form reuses the canonical runtime selector instead of free-text provider, model, and reasoning fields. From the CLI, a runtime input also accepts the compact `provider/model@reasoning` form, with `-` leaving provider or model unset.
- `compozy loop run` prompts in an interactive terminal only for supported required inputs still missing after defaults; `--no-prompt` fails instead, and structured or non-interactive input never prompts, so scripts stay deterministic.
- Secret inputs expose Vault reference names and metadata only — a secret value never enters a catalog or an error payload. Two native tools back the new pickers: `compozy__agent_list` and metadata-only `compozy__vault_list`.
- `params.runtime` binds a declared `type: runtime` input through an exact reference such as `{{ .inputs.worker_runtime }}`. Provider, model, and reasoning are validated at bind time, while literal runtime objects keep compile-time typo detection, and the resolved runtime records `input` provenance.
- If a saved reference is no longer listed, the field keeps the exact value visible so the daemon returns a field-level error instead of silently replacing it.

```yaml
inputs:
  reviewer: { type: agent, default: code_reviewer }
  release_token: { type: ref, ref: { kind: secret } }
  worker_runtime:
    { type: runtime, default: { provider: codex, model: gpt-5.5-codex, reasoning: high } }
```

##### Loops can stop and ask you a question

Two new ways for a Loop to bring a person into a run: an `ask` node parks the run until someone answers a question, and a `review` block parks an action node until someone decides on the arguments it is about to run with. Both are answerable from the web run page, the CLI, HTTP, UDS, and native tools, so an agent supervising a Loop never depends on the web UI to unblock it. (#427)

- `compozy loop requests` lists what is waiting, `compozy loop request` reads one, and `compozy loop respond` answers it. Agents get `compozy__loop_requests`, `compozy__loop_request`, and `compozy__loop_respond`.
- The run page's **Needs you** region presents one question at a time — a "Question 1 of N" header steps through several instead of stacking forms. The bounded redacted context preview and the node and generation that asked sit behind a closed **Details** disclosure.
- The answer form renders only what the daemon authorized. An ask generates its fields from the `expect` schema, with enum values as choices and booleans as Yes or No; a review shows the proposed arguments with that node's own decision allowlist, so an unauthorized decision is absent rather than a disabled button. On `edit`, the fields arrive pre-filled with the proposed arguments.
- An answer that fails the shape comes back with the failure on the field that caused it and the request stays open. A request someone else already answered — or whose run has ended — shows the recorded outcome instead of a form.
- Each fan-out lane carries its own request, named by lane and answerable independently. The waits rail counts pending requests alongside timers and events.

```yaml
# a review block on an action node
review:
  when: inputs.environment == "production"
  prompt: "Review the production release"
  decisions: [approve, edit, reject, respond]
  responders: { agents: deny }
  on_reject: { route: repair_release }
```

```bash
compozy loop respond --run-id <run-id> --node publish --decision approve
```

##### Loops take one path and tell you why

A Loop graph can now pick exactly one forward path with a `route` control node, and a gate verdict can route the same way, instead of forcing authors to encode every choice as nested branches. Each decision is recorded durably, so an operator or an agent reads why a run went the way it did rather than inferring it. (#427)

- A `route` node checks its CEL conditions in declaration order and takes the first match, falling back to a mandatory `default`. Every destination must be a unique direct forward edge.
- A broken condition fails closed with `predicate_evaluation_failed`; it never falls through to the default.
- Gate verdicts (`pass`, `fail`, `error`, `timeout`, `invalid_output`) route to `continue`, `revise`, `next_generation`, `escalate`, `halt`, or an in-body forward target written as `{ route: node_id }`. `approval` accepts only `escalate` or `halt`, so an object route cannot slip past a pending approval.
- Run status carries `generations[].route_causes` — the route node or gate, the selected forward node, the lane index, the cause, and the time. It is read from the durable `route_taken` event, so HTTP, CLI, native-tool status, and SSE replay agree.

Migration notes: the `branch` gate action is removed and is now rejected at authoring time.

```yaml
- id: classify
  class: control
  kind: route
  routes:
    - { when: nodes.score.output.value >= 0.8, to: publish }
    - { when: nodes.score.output.value >= 0.5, to: revise }
  default: reject
```

##### Loops UI and empty catalogs match their design contract

Every Loops surface adopts the approved visual contract's locked review decisions, collapse and section grammar, icon budget, and truthfulness rules, rendering only daemon-backed data and adding no helper copy. Jobs, Triggers, and Tasks share one zero-inventory empty state with the same composition, density, and icon grammar. (#406, #409)

- Automation suggestions and task templates are empty-state affordances again: they render only in the unfiltered zero-inventory state instead of sitting above a populated Jobs catalog.
- The three catalogs compose the same components and differ only in icon, title, support line, action, and panel content.

##### Manage follow-ups without losing them when a turn is interrupted

Queued follow-ups survive interruption of the active turn, including agent- and Goal-owned entries. Edit, remove, steer, or explicitly clear the queue from the session controls. Clearing writes durable actor-attributed records and is also available through `compozy session input clear` and the corresponding HTTP/UDS and native-tool surfaces.

Send identities make retries idempotent: retrying the same message returns its recorded outcome, while reusing the identity with different content is rejected. When an acknowledgment is lost, the client shows Not confirmed and retries the original identity. Daemon-generated follow-ups now use the same durable queue.

PR: [#557](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/557).

##### Pin, rename, and bind any command

The palette learns your workspace. Pins float the commands you always want first, ranking signals push the ones you actually use, aliases give a command your own vocabulary, and any command can take a chord — including a system-wide one on the desktop app. (#441)

- Pins and recents are workspace-scoped and shared across every attached client, so a pin made in the desktop shell shows up in the browser tab. `personalization = false` turns ranking and recents off as one desired state.
- An alias is 1–32 characters with no whitespace, unique in the workspace, and searchable alongside the command's title.
- Bindings, aliases, and pins are validated against the complete effective keymap. A conflict names the command that currently owns the chord or alias and stores nothing; `--overwrite` transfers it as one atomic change.
- The desktop shell registers global hotkeys — `meta+shift+Space` summons CompozyOS with the palette open by default — and reports per-machine truth for each one: **active**, **captured** by another app, **permission required** (with a shortcut into macOS Accessibility settings), or **unsupported**. A browser tab shows the section disabled with the reason _requires desktop shell_ rather than pretending.
- Settings → Palette exposes the agent fallback and personalization; Settings → Layouts → Shortcuts owns the keymap, aliases, and the global section.

```bash
compozy cmd-palette pin palette.view.sessions --workspace acme
compozy cmd-palette alias set session.new new --workspace acme
compozy cmd-palette bind palette.view.tasks meta+shift+KeyY --workspace acme
compozy cmd-palette bind palette.summon.global meta+shift+Space --global
compozy cmd-palette personalization show --workspace acme -o json
```

```toml
[cmd_palette]
personalization = true

[cmd_palette.aliases]
"session.new" = "new"

[window_manager.global_shortcuts]
"palette.summon.global" = "meta+shift+Space"
```

##### Reconnect and read long sessions with a truthful live view

Session streams recover from their last delivered position, including an empty catch-up acknowledgment when already current. Brief interruptions stay quiet; repeated failures show Reconnecting, then Disconnected with Try again. Sending while disconnected keeps the draft. Compaction and retention recovery preserve a consistent active turn and replace expired history windows explicitly.

Completed tool work and settled turns fold into readable summaries, interrupted work stays open, and Thinking is explicit. Reading older history or expanding work no longer competes with live scrolling. Large payloads have Show all and Download controls; stop and steering provenance remain visible on the relevant messages.

Bounded agent event ingestion and durable-history recovery prevent a slow watcher from wedging the producer or silently losing accepted output. Streaming redaction was optimized while preserving its output.

PR: [#557](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/557).

##### Remote gateway: reach your daemon from anywhere

A fresh install is still reachable only from the machine it runs on — and now that is a choice
instead of a limitation. The remote gateway adds three independent, off-by-default switches: a
private overlay that serves the full product to devices you pair over your own Tailscale network, a
public delivery ingress that accepts only signed webhook and bridge callbacks, and consent-gated
public operator access for devices that cannot join the overlay. (#331)

- The daemon never binds a public address. Gateway tier listeners stay on loopback and a
  connectivity provider publishes a verified route to them: an address is advertised only after the
  daemon fetches a one-time challenge through it and gets its own nonce back.
- Reaching an address is never authentication. Devices pair with single-use, five-minute artifacts
  written to private `0600` files, credentials are stored only as hashes, and
  `compozy device revoke` cancels live streams before it returns.
- `compozy gateway status|audit`, `compozy pair`, `compozy device`, and `compozy connect` (HTTPS
  profiles plus zero-exposure SSH) operate everything, with the same state in **Settings → Gateway**
  and the `compozy__gateway` native tool.
- Public delivery verifies CompozyOS's timestamped HMAC contract on every request, with replay
  protection and per-source rate limits. There is no store-and-forward while the daemon is offline —
  senders own retries.

Setup guides live in the new Gateway docs section: https://compozy.com/docs/gateway.

##### Reversible session archiving and list actions

A stopped session can now be archived so it leaves the default catalog without deleting anything. History, events, ledger, and the saved runtime choice stay readable, and unarchiving puts the session back exactly as it was — still stopped, so a normal prompt restarts it. Both session lists gained a row menu with state-aware Stop, Archive, Unarchive, and Delete, a delete confirmation, and a separate section for archived sessions. (#309)

- `compozy session archive <id>` and `compozy session unarchive <id>`, plus `compozy session list --archived` for archived only and `--include-archived` for both. Agents get `compozy__session_archive` and `compozy__session_unarchive`, and extensions get `sessions/archive` and `sessions/unarchive` under `session.write`.
- The catalog contract takes `archive=exclude|only|include` and defaults to `exclude`, with exact filtered totals and cursor fingerprints. Archived sessions are excluded from normal metrics.
- Archiving is stopped-only and idempotent. An archived session stays readable, but prompt, attach, and resume are refused until you unarchive it. Hard delete is unchanged, and archive stays catalog metadata rather than a lifecycle state.
- Bridge providers now wait for HTTP route readiness before serving, which closes a startup race across the bundled Discord, Google Chat, GitHub, Linear, Slack, Teams, Telegram, and WhatsApp runtimes.

Migration notes: existing sessions are unarchived, so nothing changes until you archive something.

##### Rewind a session to an earlier checkpoint

You can now rewind an idle session back to one of your earlier messages instead of starting over. The selected message and everything after it leave the active transcript, the message text comes back as a composer draft, and the session continues under the same session ID with a fresh agent context rebuilt only from the part you kept. Rewind touches the conversation only — it does not undo file edits, tool effects, network activity, saved memory, or anything the provider already did outside CompozyOS — and the discarded events stay archived for audit. (#310)

- `compozy session rewind <session-id>` picks the cut point with `--message-id` and reads the current transcript fences for you; scripts retrying a known request pass `--expected-generation`, `--expected-epoch`, and `--expected-max-sequence` together with the original `--idempotency-key`. Agents get `compozy__session_rewind`.
- Retrying the same rewind with the same idempotency key returns the original result, and the response carries the `draft_text` that goes back into the composer.
- A rewind is refused with a clear conflict — and without cutting the transcript — when the fence is stale, the session is busy, input is queued, an approval is pending, or the session is daemon-managed. It is serialized against clear, delete, repair, resume, and other prompt-producing operations.
- In the web UI, the action appears on your own durable messages, requires an empty composer, confirms the side-effect boundary before it runs, and restores the draft afterward.
- Reads take an `archive` selector: `compozy session events` and `compozy session history` accept `--archive active|archived|all`, and the same selector exists on the HTTP and UDS reads.

Migration notes: `session events` and `session history` now default to `archive=active`. They previously returned archived rows alongside active ones — pass `--archive all` to keep the old behavior.

##### Runtime speed is part of the runtime

`speed` joins provider, model, and reasoning as a first-class part of a Loop runtime selection, and reports the same value everywhere it is observed. (#438)

- Speed is accepted on Loop runtime inputs, per-node runtimes, Loop defaults, and `config.toml` Loop runtime defaults, and appears in resolved provenance across CLI, HTTP, UDS, native tools, SSE, and web inspection.
- The web run form reuses the existing runtime selector's Fast control rather than introducing a parallel concept, and the run inspector shows resolved provenance read-only.
- CompozyOS reports whether speed was applied or is unsupported by the chosen provider instead of inventing support it cannot deliver.

Migration notes: the session creation profile moves to v3 as a hard cut, with no v2 branch.

```yaml
runtimes:
  worker: { provider: codex, model: gpt-5.4, reasoning: high, speed: fast }
  judge: { provider: claude, model: opus, speed: normal }
```

```bash
# the compact CLI form; "-" leaves a field unset, so speed-only intent is -/-:speed=fast
compozy loop run --name release --input worker_runtime=codex/gpt-5.4@high:speed=fast
```

##### Search the full conversation and jump between your messages

Find matches in older, unloaded conversation history and jump directly to the containing message or tool result, opening the necessary folds. Search covers text, tool names, filenames, errors, inputs, and outputs. An operator-message outline and a compact message trail make long sessions easier to navigate without losing your place as output streams.

The same reads are available through `compozy session search`, `compozy session outline`, HTTP/UDS, and the corresponding native tools. Search results carry location hints so clients can open the exact matching work row.

PR: [#557](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/557).

##### Session attachments: paste, drop, or pick

The session composer accepts images (PNG, JPEG, WebP) and files (PDF, Markdown, plain text) by paste, drag-and-drop, or file picker. Attachments persist before the prompt is accepted, ride the prompt as provider-neutral references, and reach multimodal agents as protocol-conformant ACP content blocks gated by the capabilities that agent negotiated at initialization. Saving a screenshot to disk and describing its path is no longer the workaround. (#412)

- The daemon keeps the agent's prompt capabilities from the initialize handshake instead of discarding them, so unsupported content is refused in place rather than sent to an agent that never advertised it.
- Attachments render durably in the transcript across reload, live streaming, recap, and archive, and they are deleted with their session.
- The capability gate lives inside the composer's attachment strip. Steering a running prompt stays text-only.

##### Session-aware slash commands

Slash commands in the composer are now backed by a single daemon-owned catalog scoped to the exact session, and they work anywhere in a prompt rather than only at the start. Built-in and ACP control commands stay standalone, while a skill command can be dropped inline, repeated, and mixed with the text you already typed; the matched skill's full instructions are injected into that same turn. The same catalog is readable from the CLI, HTTP, UDS, and a native tool, so agents can discover what a session can actually run. (#311)

- `compozy session commands <session-id>` lists the catalog, and agents read it with `compozy__command_list` in the `compozy__catalog` toolset. `compozy__skill_view` accepts a source-qualified `command_id` from that list.
- The catalog groups Built-in, Agent, and Skills at the start of a prompt and shows only effective skills inline. A bare `/skill` resolves the effective winner across bundled, global, additional, workspace, and agent-local sources; extension skills use `/extension-id:skill` and marketplace skills use `/registry-id:skill`.
- What is effective respects global and workspace scope, agent activation and disable lists, runtime disable overlays, enabled and disabled extension resources, workspace and session ownership, and live resource revisions. A `session_commands_changed` stream frame refreshes only the affected session.
- Injection is bounded at 24 KB per skill and 64 KB per turn, and repeating the same skill activates it once. Invocations persist through admission, queueing, replay, transcript storage, and the UI, and queued ones are revalidated against the exact source before dispatch.
- Slash activation is limited to human operator input. Agent-authored prompts and `compozy__session_prompt` keep slash-shaped text literal, and hooks can remove an admitted invocation but never add one.

##### Steer a working session and see when Stop has actually finished

Follow-ups now default to steering. Runtimes that advertise live steering receive the guidance inside the active turn; other runtimes report an explicit interrupt-and-replace fallback. The composer shows what happened, restores refused drafts, and Settings lets you choose queueing instead. CLI and native-tool responses expose the send outcome and steering capability.

Stop uses cooperative cancellation, forced stop, and process-group termination with process identity checks. The UI stays at Stopping until the runtime can verify the outcome; an unverifiable stop remains visible with attention. Canceling a turn keeps the session promptable, including when escalation needs to replace its process. Restart reconciliation identifies crashed agents and stale decisions instead of leaving phantom activity.

PR: [#555](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/555).

##### Terminals stay with the workspace and welcome people and agents

Open real terminals inside CompozyOS, watch an agent's deliberate command run live, and reconnect after closing a window or reloading the app while the daemon keeps the process running. Visible agent terminals appear without taking focus. The same terminals are available through the Web and Desktop apps, CLI, HTTP/UDS, and native tools.

Authorized people and agents in the same workspace and profile can type, resize, answer input, signal, and close concurrently. Each submitted write stays whole and actor-attributed; there is no control handoff. Explicit read-only attachments remain available. Agent execution uses the approval policy, and hidden input is redacted from retained terminal surfaces.

A command journal records who ran what, approval, outcome, and boundary-detection confidence. Recording is opt-in with retention limits. Local macOS, Linux, and Windows support interactive terminals; remote sandboxes support command execution and journaling without interactive attachment.

PRs: [#490](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/490), [#552](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/552).

##### The command palette runs CompozyOS

⌘K (or ⌘⇧P) opens a palette the daemon owns. Every command — shell actions, window and desktop moves, domain views, settings, and extension contributions — is registered once in the runtime and projected to every surface, so the web app, the desktop shell, the CLI, HTTP, UDS, and native tools read the same catalog with the same availability truth. (#441)

- A row is available or it is not, and the daemon says why. A command that needs an attached shell reports `requires an attached shell` in the row itself instead of failing after you press Enter.
- Commands that need input collect it inline as typed arguments — `text`, `password`, `dropdown`, `checkbox` — before anything runs. A destructive command carries its own confirmation title and confirm verb.
- Execution is single-flight per command: a second invocation while one is still running returns `already_running` until the first reaches a terminal result, so a double Enter cannot run something twice.
- A destructive command goes through the existing tool-approval path and returns `approval_pending` with a stable approval ID. `compozy approvals show|cancel <id>` follows or ends it; approve runs exactly once, deny or cancel ends it with no effect.
- A command that acts on a shell targets one attached client. With a single attachment it auto-selects; with several it asks for an explicit client and lists every attachment ID instead of guessing.
- ⌘K on a selected row opens a filterable action panel anchored to that row: the runnable action plus Pin, Set alias, and Set shortcut. Unavailable rows expose only those meta-actions and the daemon's reason.
- The catalog is live. Installing an extension, changing a binding, or pinning from another window updates open palettes without a reload.

```bash
compozy cmd-palette list --available=false -o json   # every command with the daemon's own reason
compozy cmd-palette inspect session.new -o json      # action, arguments, execution policy, risk
compozy cmd-palette clients -o json                  # the targeting source of truth
```

##### The interface speaks plain words at a legible size

Every end-user surface moved one step up the legibility ramp and one step toward ordinary language. Body text goes from 13.5px to 15px, item titles from 15 to 16, buttons and rows get real height, the radius ladder rebases on 8, and the canvas warms up — so the interface stops asking for a magnifying glass. (#440)

- Home's first run tells the truth. Instead of seven zones filled with zeros, a fresh install shows one heading and the three starts that actually exist. A machine with an agent already running is never told nothing has happened.
- Some labels now use the word people say, while the runtime keeps its canonical noun: the dock reads **Connections** (bridges) and **Permissions** (sandbox); Settings reads **Remote access** (gateway), **Notifications** (attention), **Diagnostics** (observability), and groups them under **Personal**. The old names stay searchable.
- An alias is a label and nothing more. Code, wire payloads, CLI verbs, config keys, and generated references keep the canonical name, and the canonical noun is always one step deeper in the UI.
- "Daemon" leaves the end-user surfaces for "CompozyOS" or "this machine" across gateway, sessions, onboarding, marketplace, automation, tasks, vault, loops, and settings. Sessions get a conversation glyph instead of a terminal one.
- Small caps labels become sentence case by default, with uppercase available as an explicit variant.
- Plain language never hides the machine: install, setup, and `config.toml` still run through a terminal, and this release makes no claim of a no-terminal path.

```bash
compozy bridge list      # the dock reads "Connections"
compozy gateway status   # Settings reads "Remote access"
```

##### The workspace switcher works like Command-Tab

The fullscreen workspaces overview is rebuilt as a Command-Tab style switcher over the live shell: a glass tile strip, a frosted focus plate, an identity caption, an always-visible vertical worktree menu, a full keyboard model, and a registered `⇧⌘W` shortcut. It switches workspace identity only; window arrangements stay with the Desktops overview. (#410)

Migration notes: the previous 264 px dossier grid, with its member stacks, path footers, and "Enter →" row, is deleted rather than kept behind a flag.

##### Time travel — compare, rerun, and fork a Loop run

Durable Loop history became something you can act on. `diff` reads what changed, `rerun` opens a new generation from a settled node in the same run, and `fork` starts a linked run from a historical generation without changing its source. (#427)

- `compozy loop diff --run-id <id> --generation 1 --against-generation 2` compares two generations; `--against-run` compares two runs of the same Loop and marks different pinned definitions. Large values return their byte size and SHA-256 content hash instead of an oversized inline payload.
- `compozy loop rerun --from-node verify` re-runs the selected node and its transitive dependents while unrelated settled cells carry forward; `--item` addresses one fan-out lane. The new generation has origin `operator_rerun`.
- `compozy loop fork --generation 2` pins the source run's executed definition: generation 1 is a settled `fork_seed` baseline and generation 2 executes the body with the source inputs plus any validated overrides. Lineage is two-way — the child carries `forked_from`, the source lists `forks`.
- In the web UI, **Compare…** on an Inspect generation row opens a deep-linkable comparison page whose node rows group by the same `changed / rerun / skipped / carried / verdict` vocabulary the CLI prints, and **Fork from here** pre-fills the source run's declared inputs. Two identical generations render an explicit "nothing changed" state.
- Pass `--request-id` to retry a rerun or fork after a transport failure: the same key with identical inputs returns the committed result, and a changed request under a reused key returns `timetravel_key_reuse`.
- Agents need the `loops.timetravel` capability and get `compozy__loop_diff`, `compozy__loop_rerun`, and `compozy__loop_fork`. Diff is an ordinary workspace-scoped read. An agent cannot rerun its own executing run, but it may rerun its own terminal run.

```bash
compozy loop diff  --run-id <run-id> --generation 1 --against-generation 2
compozy loop rerun --run-id <run-id> --from-node verify --reason "retry verification"
compozy loop fork  --run-id <run-id> --generation 2 --input service=payments
```

##### Trigger detail is a rule page

A trigger now reads as the rule it is, not as a job inspector with the cron stripped out: a plain-language sentence of what the trigger does, a labeled Enable switch opposite it as the only accent on the page, one When / If / Then card, a single-open Recent-runs accordion, a four-card rail, and an Inspect sheet for runtime internals. (#411)

Migration notes: the shared automation detail panel is jobs-only again, and triggers render through their own component family.

##### Unified docs and Marketplace

`compozy.com` now serves a single `/docs` experience with reworked navigation, breadcrumbs, responsive layouts, generated CLI reference pages, and API references that include Go examples. A new `/marketplace` section lists skills, extensions, MCP entries, bridge providers, and bundled capabilities with search, install commands, and detail pages. (#277)

Migration notes: two CLI verbs were renamed and their old spellings removed — `compozy mcp authorize <server>` is now `compozy mcp auth login <server>`, and `compozy memory extractor list-pending` is now `compozy memory extractor list-failures`. The `compozy network work status` alias was removed in favor of `compozy network work lookup`, and `compozy network send --body` accepts a kind-specific JSON value rather than requiring an object.

##### Window tabs in the OS shell

The OS shell now groups windows into first-class tab frames instead of assuming one window per app. Tabs carry ordered members, an active member, per-tab navigation stacks, pinning, scoped close and reopen, and bounded history. The same topology is exposed through Web, CLI, HTTP, UDS, native tools, streams, hooks, resources, layout profiles, and the bundled CompozyOS skill, so agents operate windows with the same semantics people see. (#287)

- Run multiple instances of the same app, discover their tabs from the dock and the command palette, and drag to group, reorder, or tear out a tab.
- Move, swap, and zoom by frame instead of by single window, and adjust Window Manager behavior directly from Settings.
- `compozy config set window_manager.*` applies through the canonical Settings section endpoint, so a live apply projects only that section and unrelated restart-required drift stays pending and truthful in `compozy status`.

Migration notes: persisted window layouts move to v3 as a hard cut — v2 layout compatibility paths and singleton-window assumptions were removed from the runtime, generated contracts, and layout profiles.

#### Fixes

##### A burst of tool updates no longer drops the provider

An ACP provider can emit hundreds of state-equivalent updates for a single tool call. Those duplicates filled the active prompt's bounded event channel, stalled delivery, and disconnected an otherwise healthy provider. CompozyOS now keeps one canonical projection per tool call for the duration of the prompt. (#442, fixes #439)

- Only redundant nonterminal updates are suppressed. A new title, name, kind, input, or prechecked state still comes through, and terminal results and prompt completion keep their order.
- The projection is prompt-scoped and keyed by the current `tool_call_id`; it is discarded when the prompt ends and never enters a session, workspace, or global store.
- Public event shapes are unchanged — nothing about the session transcript contract moved.
- Verified against 1,100 identical in-progress updates followed by a terminal one: both the original prompt and a follow-up completed with a single call/result pair and no disconnect.

##### A crashed agent no longer looks like a finished one

When an agent process disconnected mid-answer, the stream simply ended — and everything downstream read that silence as success. A CLI consumer reached end of file and exited zero, `compozy__session_prompt` returned a result, and the only evidence left behind was stderr with no exit code. Streams are now fail-closed: success requires an explicit completion event, and disconnect, terminal error, and process exit stay three distinct outcomes. (#315, #319)

- Chunks already received stay persisted and visible. CompozyOS never synthesizes a completion for them.
- A stream that ends after partial output without a completion event fails the CLI with a clear non-zero exit, and terminal error frames are forwarded before the error is returned so machine-readable diagnostics survive.
- `compozy__session_prompt` classifies a subprocess exit as `tool_backend_failed` with `backend_dead` instead of reporting success; the partial events remain readable in the session transcript.
- Crash evidence now carries the subprocess exit code and, where the operating system exposes it, the terminating signal.
- Fatal cleanup gives the process a bounded grace period to exit on its own before being stopped, so the real exit result is no longer lost to a race with forced teardown.
- CompozyOS does not replay a prompt automatically, because a prompt may already have caused external side effects. Sending the next prompt restarts the agent process and continues the same session and transcript.

Migration notes: crash bundles move to `compozy.session_crash_bundle.v2` with structured `exit_code` and `signal`, with no v1 branch. Any consumer that treated a closed stream as success will now correctly see a failure unless a completion event was sent.

##### A finished Loop leaves nothing running

A completed or failed Loop run could leave live descendant work behind — including a next-generation source task sitting in `ready` with no task run attached. The terminal transaction now drains every open descendant, covering ready-only tasks and `needs_attention` runs, on both normal terminal settlement and coordinator execution failure. (#438)

- The public reproduction ends with zero open tasks: the run reports failed, its next-generation task is canceled, and no descendant survives.

##### A guarded history reference no longer crashes generation 1

A Loop that referenced `previous.*` defensively still failed on its first generation, because the history namespace did not exist yet when templates were evaluated. The complete shape of `previous.*` and the generation history namespaces is now defined before evaluation, so documented guarded references validate and generation 1 runs. (#438)

- History construction is topology-aware, so a node sees the namespaces its position actually implies.
- Template and materialization failures stay inside the node lifecycle instead of escalating into an opaque coordinator failure.
- Canonical compiler, linter, namespace, coordinator, and control-flow suites cover the behavior.

```gotemplate
{{ if .previous.generation }}
The prior quality gate returned {{ .previous.verdicts.quality.outcome }}.
Blocking issues: {{ .previous.verdicts.quality.blocking_issues }}
{{ end }}
```

##### Autonomous extraction stays out of curated memory

The autonomous memory extractor could write operational chatter into curated memory, and a generated slug collision could overwrite an unrelated entry. The deterministic scanner now rejects Memory v2 operational identifiers — `memory_propose`, native `compozy__memory_*` tool names, controller event names, and scanner rule IDs — and extractor, provider, and dreaming candidates no longer update an existing memory solely because their generated slug collides. Explicit filename-collision updates from direct CLI or user writes keep working. (#396)

##### Carry the selected Profile through Loop compilation and worker sessions

Profile-scoped Agents, Skills, Loops, and Session references now resolve consistently through validation, persisted responses, and execution. Orchestrated implementers and nested daemon-issued Session commands retain the validated caller Profile while preserving workspace and identity checks.

Lifecycle extension tools are authorable only in the workspace and Profile where they are enabled. Compilation sees the same tool schema and placement as execution, with normal validation and permission policy still enforced.

Loop-managed sessions also inherit configured ACP options and speed, with explicit runtime options taking precedence. This prevents session creation-profile mismatches before the provider starts.

PRs: [#527](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/527), [#531](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/531), [#542](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/542).

##### Dry-run proves the run you are about to submit

A Loop could validate, dry-run cleanly, and then fail at submission with `executed definition template manifest changed`. The compiler folded default values into the definition it stored, but compiled templates from the definition _before_ those defaults — so a persisted run carried more template keys than its own snapshot, and hydration rightly refused it. Compilation now uses one canonical definition throughout, and dry-run exercises the exact snapshot boundary a real submission uses. (#313, #317)

- Defaults are folded once at the start of compilation and used for linting, contracts, nodes, watch events, graph metadata, and child Loops alike — so omitted child `mode` values no longer appear out of nowhere during hydration.
- A snapshot must load through the production loader before its bytes or digest are returned; one that cannot round-trip can no longer reach storage.
- `compozy loop run --dry-run` and `compozy__loop_run` with `dry: true` run that same check, so a preview can no longer approve a definition that submission would reject.
- A mismatch now names the manifest kind, the exact key, and its source instead of reporting a generic failure.

Migration notes: no storage, API, CLI, or configuration contract changed. Integrity checks were not relaxed — inconsistent definitions are still rejected, just earlier and with a readable reason.

##### Restart a stopped session and keep its runtime

A stopped session used to be a dead end: the UI went read-only and the only way forward was creating a new one. Sending a normal prompt to a stopped session now restarts its agent process, reloads the retained provider history, and continues under the same session ID and transcript. The provider, model, reasoning effort, and speed you picked are stored on the session itself, so they survive a stop and a daemon restart instead of silently reverting to the default. (#307)

- The lifecycle gained a `starting` state, and a normal prompt is the only operation that moves a stopped session back toward execution. `session resume` stays attach-only, and queue, steer, interrupt, and attach do not restart a session.
- `compozy session runtime set <id>` takes `--provider`, `--model`, `--reasoning-effort`, and `--speed`, and `compozy session runtime clear <id>` drops the choice. Both fence on `--expected-revision` and report a conflict on a stale one. Agents get `compozy__session_runtime_set` and `compozy__session_runtime_clear`; extensions get `sessions/runtime/set` and `sessions/runtime/clear` under `session.write`.
- Session reads expose `runtime.selected`, `runtime.effective`, and `runtime.selection_revision`. A prompt resolves its runtime from an explicit snapshot first, then the stored selection, then the current effective values, and an already-queued prompt keeps the snapshot it was accepted with.
- The composer stays enabled for a stopped session, and closing a session window during a live turn no longer breaks the transcript view.

Migration notes: the `Use as Goal` action on settled assistant messages is removed. `/goal` is the single entry point for Goals.

##### Durable inputs for busy sessions

Queue, Steer, and Interrupt are now daemon-owned durable operations instead of client-side intent that could quietly disappear. An input is persisted before it is acknowledged, survives a refresh and a daemon restart, dispatches exactly once in FIFO order, and can be listed, edited, canceled, or promoted to steering by its entry ID from the CLI, HTTP, UDS, native tools, or the extension host. Disruptive changes are fenced against the turn you meant to change, so a stale client cannot interrupt a newer turn. (#304)

- `compozy session prompt` accepts `--queue`, `--interrupt`, and `--steer`; `compozy session input list|edit|steer|cancel` manages pending input by its persisted ID.
- The queue is readable and mutable over HTTP and UDS at `/api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/sessions/{session_id}/prompt/queue`, including per-entry replace, steer, and cancel.
- Agents get `compozy__session_inputs_list`, `compozy__session_input_replace`, `compozy__session_input_cancel`, and `compozy__session_input_promote`.
- The composer clears only after the daemon acknowledges, a failure keeps your draft, and a refresh reconstructs pending input from the daemon. Queued, steered, interrupted, canceled, accepted, and dropped markers no longer render as warnings, and an expected ACP cancellation no longer appears in the transcript as a provider failure.

Migration notes: the dedicated interrupt endpoint is removed — interrupt is now a prompt mode plus a fenced queue operation. The legacy ACP steer handler and the runtime steer source are removed, and the web client no longer mirrors the queue in local state.

##### Durable session messaging

Session prompts no longer duplicate, reorder, or disappear when an optimistic Web message settles, when a client reconnects, or after a cold reload. Every externally authored prompt now carries two durable identities — `message_id` for the rendered message and `idempotency_key` for the command execution — and both survive Web rendering, HTTP/UDS/CLI/native-tool ingress, queueing or steering, ACP dispatch, transcript projection, replay, and reload. (#288)

- Retrying the same prompt across supported transports is at-most-once when the original identities are reused: an exact retry returns the original result with `replayed: true` without re-running hooks or the provider.
- Divergent reuse of an identity returns a typed conflict, and uncertain post-dispatch recovery is reported as indeterminate instead of silently resending.
- Goal retries preserve the original result and the original HTTP status.
- Provider-originated ACP `user_message_chunk` echoes no longer appear as a second authored message, while locally authored steer events are preserved.
- The CLI, the Extension Host, and `compozy__session_prompt` expose the retry identities.

Migration notes: external prompt and steer inputs now require both `message_id` and `idempotency_key`, and Goal prompt responses use the standard wrapped prompt-result envelope.

##### Fan-out filters actually filter

A `filter` on a fan-out node was accepted at authoring time but never applied, so batching and `max_fan_out` still saw the whole candidate list. Each filter is now evaluated against the raw candidate before batching and branch limits. (#438)

- The candidate `item`, its original `index`, the fan-out alias, and outer fan-out aliases are all available during compilation and evaluation.
- Original order and candidate indexes survive filtering.
- Zero matches is a valid zero-branch materialization, not an error.
- A predicate failure routes through the existing `on_eval_error` policy instead of being silently ignored.

```yaml
- id: inspect_files
  class: control
  kind: fan-out
  collection: "{{ .nodes.changed.output.files }}"
  filter: "item.endsWith('.go')" # now decides what gets batched
  batch_size: 1
  max_fan_out: 8
```

##### Four runtime regressions around prompts, permissions, and settlement

A cluster of failures where the runtime reported the wrong thing about its own state. (#447)

- **Prompts stop replaying history** (fixes #399). Submitting a message sent the entire persisted chat transcript to the session prompt endpoint. Only the newest user message goes now, with its original message ID and retry idempotency preserved.
- **Permissions follow the live agent** (fixes #415). The observer carried a duplicate permission-mode resolver instead of the resource-backed agent catalog the daemon uses. Live snapshots are built from effective permissions and cached by runtime identity and revision, so a revision change can no longer leave stale permissions in place; a stopped session's fallback snapshot stays deliberately shallow.
- **A committed result survives a failed publish** (fixes #435). A pre-commit lease failure and a post-commit publication failure looked identical, so an already-settled run could be failed and settled a second time. A claimed run fails only when completion returned no committed run.
- **A crashed process is reported as crashed** (fixes #436). A non-zero exit code or a signal is now classified as a process failure and maps to the process-exited stop cause. A clean exit with code `0` after a transport failure stays on the transport path and keeps `error`, so `agent_crashed` means the subprocess actually died.

##### Keep skipped Loop branches and unresolved review findings honest

Exclusive routing no longer executes a dominated branch later in the same planning pass. Skipped downstream and fan-out steps settle as Not taken instead of appearing permanently pending after the run ends; work that ran in earlier rounds keeps its history.

Review-and-fix findings that are valid but blocked or unresolved remain pending and retain their status. Invalid findings remain invalid. Finalization no longer counts those findings as resolved simply because the review round finished.

PRs: [#529](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/529), [#543](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/543), [#544](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/544).

##### Keep terminal output and session activity visible through lifecycle races

A short-lived terminal that exits while the browser is attaching now keeps its exited state when an older catalog response arrives late. The exit bar and retained output remain discoverable. Terminal selection controls no longer resize the process and clear the selection, hidden panes no longer publish invalid dimensions, and a completed CLI detach no longer causes an unintended reconnect.

Session stream closure drains the persisted stop marker. The pending-reply indicator also appears when a delayed React effect has already consumed its initial guard interval, instead of staying hidden indefinitely. Delayed Settings navigation and runtime-selector closing focus no longer override a newer operator action.

PRs: [#547](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/547), [#557](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/557). CI follow-ups: [862e138](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/commit/862e138113f438e532777421ae3b85343162360e), [52d2c4a](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/commit/52d2c4a63f8dbaa429ff61f31671f52bee8a518b).

##### Live changelog and composer fixes

The changelog on `compozy.com` now reads published releases directly from GitHub at request time instead of depending on a bot pushing a generated page back into `main` after every release. Each release gets its own page with rendered Markdown, category sections, evidence, compare links, and downloadable assets, plus an RSS feed at `/changelog/feed.xml`, and releases now appear in site search, the sitemap, and the text feeds that agents read. (#292)

- Typing in the session composer no longer swallows spaces.
- A window-manager WebSocket upgrade that fails for a missing workspace now returns a proper preflight error frame, and the web client refreshes a stale workspace list when it sees that error instead of staying stuck.

Migration notes: the release workflow no longer publishes a site changelog receipt commit, and the generator scripts behind it are removed.

##### Loop runs keep their lineage, permissions, and results

Three Loop defects that broke supervision of long runs are fixed. (#420, #407, #408)

- Loop-owned Goal sessions retain the trusted provenance of the session that started the current or nearest ancestor Loop Run, so session catalogs and the Web group Goal work below its originating session. The relationship stays informational: Goal sessions remain `type=system` with no inherited TTL, auto-stop, spawn budget, or permission narrowing, provenance is derived server-side within the same workspace, and spawn limits still count only contiguous spawned ancestry. (#420)
- Daemon-owned terminal tool effects are authorized correctly. The native policy path treated the synthetic `loop-effect` audit label as an authored workspace agent and failed the lookup before the declared tool could run. The trusted daemon actor kind is now preserved through policy resolution, the label survives for attribution, and workspace policy still denies foreign targets. (#407)
- Terminal effect results stay visible in run details. The Web hook closed its event stream as soon as it received the terminal status, so a later retained or live effect-results frame never reached the run timeline, and reloading repeated the race. Successful and denied effect results now arrive in order while replacement, deactivation, navigation, and unmount keep the normal cleanup path. (#408)

##### Loop runs you can debug from the run page

A Loop run that failed used to be a dead end: every attempt died with "The agent output did not satisfy the action output schema", the node was quarantined, "Open quarantine entry" opened an empty sheet, "Open session" returned 404, the cell task sat in "Queued · attempt 1 of 10" forever, and Usage confidently reported `0 / ~$0.00`. The agent had actually answered correctly every time — the daemon joined streamed text fragments with a newline, which landed inside a JSON string and corrupted a valid reply. That joiner is fixed, and so is every surface that made the failure impossible to read. (#324)

- The agent now sees the authored `output_schema` in its prompt instead of prose that never said "JSON", extraction validates every candidate object newest-first (a quoted `package.json` no longer shadows the real answer), and the failure cause carries the underlying detail instead of one generic sentence.
- Quarantine is routed to the node that actually failed. Parked consumers collapse into a single row — "**execute task is quarantined** — collect, review, verify and approve are parked behind it until it is requeued" — with one button that opens the producer's entry, and `node_attention_flagged` is finally emitted when a run parks.
- Loop cells no longer stall in `ready` after a failed run: quarantine parks them as needs-attention and requeueing clears the park. The misleading `of 10` attempt ceiling is gone, since the Loop owns the retry budget.
- Daemon-claimed runs stop writing placeholder session ids, the real ACP session is bound to the lease under a claim token, and run detail exposes `generations[].outputs[].session_id` — so "Open session" works from the hero and from every node row that has one.
- The task list nests Loop cells under their coordinator with an escalation-first summary ("9 subtasks · 1 needs attention · 2 running") and readable identities like `g2.execute_task` instead of `loop.lo`.
- When a provider reports no tokens, Usage now reads "not reported" and "—" instead of a confident zero; the cost estimate returns only when tokens exist.

Migration notes: adds the `attention_producer_node_id` column to `loop_node_controls` through migration `00055`; run-detail payloads gain `node_controls[].attention_producer_node_id` and `generations[].outputs[].session_id`.

##### Managed run-agent workers keep their lineage and let go

Two lifecycle bugs in Loop `run-agent` actions, both reproduced against `v0.3.0-beta.18`: a managed worker lost the trail back to the session that started it, and a worker could outlive the Loop cell it belonged to. (#446, fixes #444 and #445)

- A managed worker now records the nearest originating session as informational parent lineage — parent and root are readable from the session — without borrowing or hijacking that origin session.
- When a Loop cell settles successfully, the run-owned worker binding closes and durable terminal cleanup is enqueued in the same atomic step. Cancellation and terminal failure follow the same path, and cleanup cannot run twice.
- A retryable output failure keeps the same worker session active instead of orphaning it, so a retry reuses the worker and only terminal settlement ends it.
- No public API, schema, migration, or config key changed; existing Loop and session reads simply expose corrected stored state.

##### Skills load through the native seam inside managed sessions

Managed sessions load installed skills through the native `compozy__skill_view` tool only — including skills that are not listed in the prompt catalog. The earlier attempt to give managed agents a private CLI socket is removed rather than kept as a fallback: provider code runs as the daemon user, so environment values, headers, process ancestry, and file modes cannot tell those requests apart from an operator's. (#314, #323)

- If session policy denies the native tool, the agent reports the skill unavailable instead of shelling out or reading skill files directly.
- Every `compozy skill` verb detects managed-session markers before doing any client, socket, registry, or filesystem work and points the caller at `compozy__skill_list`, `compozy__skill_search`, and `compozy__skill_view`. This is documented as a support guard, not an authorization boundary — same-user code can still clear those markers.
- Hosted-MCP bind windows now start after ACP initialization and immediately before session negotiation. A cold provider launch that takes longer than the bind window no longer expires the tool seam before the agent can use it; a bind attempted before activation still fails closed.

Migration notes: the managed CLI transport is deleted — the socket, `COMPOZY_AGENT_TRANSPORT_SOCKET`, the managed identity headers, and the managed skill API scope. Operator CLI behavior from a normal shell is unchanged.

##### Memory and dreaming require explicit opt-in

CompozyOS is a control plane, so it no longer starts persistent memory extraction or background
dreaming from omitted settings. `memory.enabled` and `roles.dream.enabled` now default to `false`.
To enable memory, set `memory.enabled = true` in `config.toml` and restart the daemon. Dreaming
requires the separate `roles.dream.enabled = true` opt-in; enabling memory alone leaves it off.

The enabled extractor now requests an explicit no-candidate result, accepts conventional empty
responses and JSONL fences, and preserves valid candidates from mixed output. Malformed lines
remain diagnosable failures instead of silently disappearing. Extraction failures and timeouts
appear in the configured DLQ and extractor failure listing. Child-stop details distinguish failed
or timed-out extraction from a parsed child response; successful inbox production owns the
`memory.extractor.completed` event.

Session pressure compaction remains independently controlled by `session.compaction.enabled`.
It reuses checkpoint coverage and may launch a summary child when an active session reaches the
pressure threshold, even with persistent memory disabled. Idle sessions and session-end memory
updates do not start that work. An explicit checkpoint-role opt-out or a failed summary leaves
uncovered events unarchived.

### Migration notes

No configuration is rewritten and no stored memory is deleted. Existing explicit `true` or `false`
values retain their meaning; omitted values use the new disabled defaults. Profile and workspace
role overrides keep their precedence under the daemon memory master switch. Existing public keys,
tools, routes, and response shapes remain available. Raw extraction failures require a new
extraction; replay remains limited to normalized candidate inbox failures. (#561)

##### One owner per Loop run, and cancellation that sticks

Loop action runs now have exactly one daemon-owned worker, cancellation survives a restart, and a session that needs CompozyOS tools fails before the provider starts instead of running without them. Fresh CompozyOS homes also start with the bundled `dev-cycle` extension already enabled, while a home that has been booted before keeps whatever you chose. (#321, #322, #326)

- Coordinators and ordinary task-role sessions can no longer activate or bootstrap a run that the dedicated `loop-action` executor already owns.
- When the effective agent or lineage policy requires concrete tools and hosted MCP cannot provide them, session startup fails closed with `ErrHostedMCPUnavailable` before the provider process is launched.
- Loop cancellation is durable: delivery state is persisted, delivery is idempotent, the run advances to draining once acknowledged, and anything still pending is retried from daemon boot and from scheduler sweeps — no restart required to converge.
- Resuming a stopped session discards the stopped ledger projection first and restores it if provider startup or the clear rolls back, so forensic projections stop conflicting and the full history is rematerialized on the next stop.
- Enablement of a bundled extension is a fresh-home default, not an override: generic local and marketplace installs stay disabled by default, and stored state survives restart and update.

##### Pi providers receive the secret, not its variable name

CompozyOS wrote a Pi credential slot's target environment name, such as `ZAI_API_KEY`, straight into the session `models.json` `apiKey` field. Pi reads a bare uppercase value as a literal API key, so the provider received the variable name instead of the secret, the upstream request failed, and the session could finish without an assistant message. The Pi runtime now writes `$ZAI_API_KEY`-style references, which Pi resolves from the secret CompozyOS already injects into the provider process. (#404)

Migration notes: this covers the built-in `pi_acp` bound-secret providers — z.ai, OpenRouter, Moonshot/Kimi, xAI, MiniMax, Mistral, Groq, and Vercel AI Gateway.

##### Recover a Loop-owned task run without losing its place

A Loop worker task run parked in `needs_attention` had no honest way back. Generic subprocess-health escalation swallowed Loop-owned crashes, and `task run recover` re-enqueued a run that no longer belonged to its Loop. (#447, fixes #437)

- A confirmed agent crash inside a Loop-owned task run stays out of the generic escalation path and projects into the Loop's own node control and event model as worker attention.
- `task run recover` now fails the parked source run, creates and links a child run, and rebinds it to the exact same Loop node and item with the next attempt and epoch — all atomically. Workspace, runtime selection, designation, worktree, network, capabilities, and metadata stay attached to that cell, and attention plus death-streak state is cleared.
- Recovery diagnostics point where they should: a run that needs attention names `task run recover`, while an active run names cancellation.
- No schema, migration, or config key changed — recovery reuses the existing `wait_intervention` attention flag and the existing Loop event vocabulary.

```bash
compozy task run recover <run-id> --reason "operator recovery" -o json
```

##### Recover Loop runs without losing results or reporting an old failure as current

Carried external results with identical descriptors are deduplicated, fixing task-result reads and daemon startup during recovery while retaining corruption checks for conflicting content. Current-generation activity and blockers no longer inherit an earlier generation's failure or quarantine.

Reruns respect immutable generation lineage and allocate fresh Goal binding epochs. Completed generation outputs reject stale nonterminal overwrites, and new rounds emit one generation-start event. Built-in command judges use the daemon-matched executable and environment.

The run page leads with outcomes and action results. It previews a few outputs, keeps Details available, folds quiet control and skipped steps, and shows terminal retry guidance only when the existing planner accepts that recovery.

PRs: [#547](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/547), [#554](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/554).

##### Removing the suggested Home folder no longer breaks the desktop

Onboarding seeded every daemon registration into the selectable project draft, including the internal operator-home registration that Global runs on. Removing the suggested Home folder deleted that registration and left a desktop where dock apps took focus but opened nothing. (#440)

- Onboarding now partitions project workspaces from the operator home, so that row can never be seeded, added, or deleted as a project.
- The fix is covered by the canonical onboarding suite, with three cases that fail against the previous behavior.

##### Report provider failures clearly and clear stale settings when switching providers

Loop actions preserve quota, authentication, transport, timeout, and refusal failures before validating the model's output. An expired login or usage limit is no longer disguised as an invalid JSON result; genuine malformed model output still fails schema validation.

Changing an Agent's provider with `compozy agent update` clears the previous provider's model, command, reasoning effort, and ACP options unless you explicitly supply replacements. Providers that do not support reasoning configuration reject it during resolution instead of failing later at session startup.

##### Resource-only extensions need no toolchain

An extension that ships only declared resources — agents, skills, Loops, automations, layouts — can now use `build`, `dev`, `reload`, and `dev --watch` without installing a Go or TypeScript toolchain. The passive build path validates and publishes those resources without running build or describe subprocesses, and active development links project them into the linked workspace while preserving deterministic generations, atomic reload, and last-good fallback. The Go and TypeScript paths are unchanged, and the resource-only path fails closed. (#423)

##### Previous-release sessions remain readable after upgrade

Sessions created by 0.3.0-beta.21 remain readable after upgrading. The persisted
creation-profile codec accepts versions 4 and 5, validates their fields, and keeps
historical profile references, policy digests, and creation digests unchanged.
New runtime profiles continue to use version 5.

Unreadable session metadata now produces a bounded scan summary with at most five
examples. An unchanged set repeats at most once every five minutes per scanner;
changed failures are reported immediately. `compozy doctor --only
runtime.session_metadata -o json` reports live counts and a bounded sample,
including missing or invalid catalog creation witnesses.

Migration notes: the version 4 to 5 change added optional ACP selections. Version
4 profiles upgrade through the persistence codec with no selections, preserving
their original bytes and hashes instead of rewriting immutable witnesses. No SQL
migration, config change, session deletion, or manual reset is required. Unknown
versions and corrupted witnesses remain rejected and unchanged. This does not
change dreaming defaults or claim to reproduce the reported CPU/disk measurements.

##### Run the Linux AppImage without installing libfuse2

Linux AppImages now embed the static runtime, allowing distributions with FUSE 3 to launch the app without installing `libfuse2`. Release, local, and update-test packaging share the same runtime selection. The extraction fallback remains available for environments without kernel FUSE support.

PR: [#548](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/548).

##### The daemon owns a managed worker's outcome

A managed Loop worker session could call complete or fail and race the daemon's own validated action result, so what a generation recorded depended on which side got there first. The daemon is now the single terminal authority for managed workers. (#438)

- A worker session may heartbeat while it holds the lease, but terminal settlement calls are denied by session lineage.
- A generation settles as succeeded only with schema-valid structured output; an invalid capture terminates as `invalid_output` instead of passing.
- The exact validated object round-trips through inline and content-addressed storage, including downstream template and CEL hydration, so a large output no longer loses required fields.

##### The desktop stays responsive with a large session catalog

Long-running sessions with a large internal session catalog put the macOS desktop into a request-and-reload feedback loop that made it unusable. The two-second liveness probe now targets a bounded `GET /api/status/identity` surface over HTTP and UDS instead of the full status aggregate, and internal sessions stop inflating the public catalog. (#414)

- Memory-extractor, auto-title, and dream sessions no longer publish wake events to the public session catalog.
- Built-in background agents, including `dreaming-curator`, resolve through effective workspace configuration instead of being reported as missing workspace-authored agents.
- The identity contract ships in OpenAPI and the generated TypeScript types.

##### Zoom a window without covering its tiled neighbors

Zoom now moves a window or its entire tab frame to a separate regular desktop when needed, preserving the other windows. Unzoom returns the unit through its saved layout anchors and removes an empty desktop created for zoom. Tiling another window ends zoom and gives the new neighbor its own space.

Persisted version 3 layouts migrate losslessly to the current layout shape, preserving tab order and the active tab. Layout streams now use heartbeats, stalled-stream recovery, and authoritative reconnect fences so the browser catches up after a disconnect.

Moving one window no longer forces unchanged windows to render again, reducing work during layout updates from another browser or the CLI. The existing 12-window drag, restore, and peer-convergence performance limits remain enforced.

PR: [#525](https://github.com/compozy/compozy/pull/525).

#### Highlights

##### Gateway docs: zero to GitHub webhooks

compozy.com gains a dedicated Gateway section written for first-time operators: a ten-minute
quickstart from `gateway.enabled` to a paired phone, a step-by-step "Receive GitHub webhooks"
tutorial verified end to end — including why a native repository webhook cannot sign CompozyOS's
generic trigger contract and the GitHub Actions workflow that can — a Tailscale extension page
covering tailnet prerequisites through clean removal, a remote CLI/SSH/public-access guide, a
devices-audit-teardown runbook, and a plain-language security page. (#331)

Migration notes: `/docs/operations/remote-gateway`, `/docs/operations/gateway-threat-model`, and
`/docs/configuration/gateway` moved into `/docs/gateway/*` as a hard cut — update saved links.

##### MCP catalog, session runtime, and extension management

CompozyOS beta expands how people and agents configure the runtime across MCP, sessions, extensions, workspace boundaries, and the session UI.

- Install, authorize, repair, inspect, and remove curated MCP servers through the CLI, HTTP/UDS APIs, Web, and the official CompozyOS skill. The catalog now uses manifest version 2, the runtime uses the official MCP SDK, and public MCP transport no longer accepts SSE. (#284)
- Choose the provider, model, reasoning effort, and speed for each session prompt, switch runtime within a session, and create sessions before their first prompt. (#283)
- Create, build, validate, develop, distribute, install, and inspect extensions through the daemon, CLI, APIs, native tools, Web, and SDK contracts. Extension manifests now use version 2. (#278)
- Apply existing session permission modes to explicitly targeted cross-workspace agent access, including session-scoped consent where a native-tool prompt is available. (#275)
- Read session transcripts through a calmer timeline with clearer tool results, failures, permissions, clarifications, and goal controls. (#271)
- Run the daemon on Windows with corrected process locking, SQLite paths, detach behavior, process timestamps, and sync-directory handling. (#274)
- Automation jobs can target Loops with workspace inputs and mappings, unresolved tool calls now fail explicitly, and Loop/session recovery paths report clearer state and errors. (#276, #279)

Migration notes: update MCP catalog manifests to version 2 and replace public SSE transport; create a session before submitting its first prompt and runtime selection; update extension manifests to version 2.

##### Spend less time repeating development and verification work

Repeated development startup and verification reuse successful evidence when source, generated artifacts, toolchain, and build settings still match. Development entry points avoid unchanged generation, and Air avoids relinking an unchanged daemon while preserving atomic publication and failed-build recovery. Explicit generation and drift checks remain available.

Web tests use the existing worker bound with a threads pool; migration fixtures reuse an empty historical prefix while still exercising real upgrades. Active lint-plugin tests are included in normal verification. The full-checkptr audit now installs its Bun dependencies and uses the existing eight-way Go partitioner without reducing instrumentation or timeouts.

Marketplace MCP configuration no longer waits for unrelated model-catalog discovery. Provider and catalog changes still reconcile normally.

##### Upgrade defaults and compatibility for session control

Persisted database state and layouts upgrade through their owning migrations. Review these session defaults when upgrading:

- `session.busy_input.default_mode` is now `steer`; choose `queue` to defer follow-ups. Live injection depends on runtime capability, and unsupported runtimes report the interrupt fallback.
- New supervision settings are `session.supervision.quiet_after` (30m) and `stop_grace` (10m). Existing `inactivity_warning_after` and `inactivity_timeout` settings retain their legacy timer behavior during the v0.4 compatibility window. For ordinary positive thresholds, migrate the warning threshold to `quiet_after` and the difference between stop and warning thresholds to `stop_grace`; check the documented zero semantics before changing disabled timers.
- `network.live.max_total_wall_time` defaults to `0`, disabling that aggregate wall budget. Set an explicit duration if you need a limit.
- Prefer `--expected-turn` over the deprecated `--expected-turn-id`. The old flag and the historical `interrupt` default remain accepted with warnings until their planned removal in v0.5.0; explicit per-send interruption remains supported.
- `compozy__session_prompt` defaults to `wait: false`. Request `wait: true` explicitly when you need a synchronous native-tool call.

### Release Notes

#### Features

##### Network delivery policies, subscriptions, and thread-to-task promotion

CompozyOS network channels gain durable delivery control. Each channel now carries a fan-out policy — deliver to all members, route to a designated coordinator peer, or match by capability (the default) — managed with `compozy network channels create` and `compozy network channels update`. Peers and tasks can subscribe to channels: inspect subscriptions with `compozy network subscriptions` and manage per-task subscriptions with `compozy task subscribe <task-id>`. Executable thread messages can be promoted into durable workspace tasks straight from the CLI with `compozy network promote`, or by an agent through the `compozy__task_promote_from_thread` native tool, and designated sibling task runs can be fanned out as part of a workflow. Network and task views now surface task links, peer and coordination cost, and delivered size and token metrics, while mentions are normalized (trimmed, empties removed) and size and token limits are enforced as non-negative.

##### Task blocking, recovery, and needs-attention triage

Tasks are now first-class to block, triage, and recover. A task can be explicitly blocked and unblocked with `compozy task block <id>` and `compozy task unblock <id>`, and every block is kept as durable history you can inspect with `compozy task blocks <id>`. A new `needs_attention` status surfaces tasks that stalled and need a human or coordinator to step in — task details now carry the blocked reason and the wake creator so it is clear why a task is waiting and who nudged it. Clear the state with `compozy task recover <id>`, recover a specific stalled run with `compozy task run recover <run-id>`, or let an agent do it through the `compozy__task_recover` native tool and the HTTP/UDS API. Task completion now returns the IDs of any tasks it created, and stronger validation rejects invalid created-task references before they are persisted. Claim tokens are redacted across task outputs and hook payloads, and the new `needs_attention_after` setting controls how long a task may wait before it is flagged for attention.

#### Fixes

##### Clearer native tool errors and availability diagnostics

Native and hosted tool calls now fail legibly. Hosted MCP tool calls return richer, structured JSON error details — the tool ID, an error code, and any denial reasons — instead of opaque failures, and advertised tools carry improved metadata and descriptions. When runtime diagnostic data cannot be retrieved, native tool lookups report a clear "unavailable" diagnostic rather than a silent miss. Hosted and session MCP availability handling is safer overall, with clearer informational and warning logs and graceful fallbacks when a feature is disabled. Documentation and the runtime envelope now consistently direct agents to the canonical `compozy__*` tool IDs and the harness-returned tool references.

### Release Notes

#### Features

##### Dependency-driven auto-enqueue

Tasks can now opt into dependency-driven auto-enqueue. When a task is marked `auto_enqueue_on_ready`, CompozyOS enqueues its next task run automatically as soon as a blocking dependency completes and the task reconciles to `ready` — so a dependency graph advances without a manual `compozy task enqueue` at each step. The behavior is conservative: only a successful completion satisfies a `blocks` edge, paused dependents are skipped, and the queued-run reservation keeps at most one open run per dependent under concurrent or retried completions. Enqueue happens only after the completion has durably committed and is best-effort — a failed enqueue is logged, never rolled back onto the completing run. It is off by default; enable it per task with `--auto-enqueue-on-ready` on `compozy task create` / `compozy task child create`, toggle it with `compozy task update`, or set the `auto_enqueue_on_ready` field over HTTP/UDS and the extension SDK.

##### Runtime evidence mode for task execution profiles

Task execution profiles can now drive worker startup and opt into runtime evidence mode. A task with no pool owner but a `worker.mode = "select"` profile now starts the selected agent, provider, and model and propagates the profile's required capabilities into its claim command. Setting `runtime.mode = "evidence"` boots that worker with guidance to run browser, simulator, and local-app validation and to capture runtime evidence. CompozyOS elevates the session to auto-approve permissions only when the profile also pins an explicit sandbox reference (`sandbox.mode = "ref"`); otherwise the configured permission policy stays in force, and evidence mode grants no extra task authority. The profile's new `runtime` block is surfaced through the execution-profile CLI, the HTTP/UDS endpoints, and the native task tools.

#### Fixes

##### Coordinator sessions wake reliably on new work

Coordinator sessions now wake reliably when new work arrives. When a task run is enqueued for a workspace that already has a running coordinator session, CompozyOS delivers a synthetic wake to that session — interrupting the agent's current turn if it is idle and waiting — so queued runs are picked up promptly instead of stalling. The same interrupt-if-waiting delivery now applies to harness re-entry and heartbeat wakes, force-retried and force-recovered runs re-trigger a coordinator wake, and heartbeat wakes skipped for non-transient reasons are recorded as dropped rather than silently lost. Wake delivery is de-duplicated per session and run and drained safely across daemon shutdown.

##### Marketplace skill installs are verified end-to-end

Marketplace skill installs are now verified end-to-end. After downloading and writing a skill, CompozyOS confirms the runtime can actually discover it as an enabled marketplace skill with matching provenance, instead of reporting success for an install that would never resolve. Installs that are disabled, shadowed by a higher-precedence skill of the same name, missing provenance, or resolved to a different slug now fail with a clear, terminal error and remediation guidance across `compozy skill install` and the daemon API. Use `compozy skill where <name>` to inspect the winning source before retrying.

##### Safe workspace deletion, plus compozy session remove and compozy open

Workspace deletion is now safe: CompozyOS refuses to delete a workspace while any of its sessions are still active — returning a 409 that names the blocking sessions — and cleans up the workspace's stopped session history transactionally when deletion proceeds. Two agent-manageable CLI commands ship alongside it: `compozy session remove <id>` deletes a single session and its persisted history, and `compozy open` opens the CompozyOS web UI in your default browser. The CLI reference also gains documentation for `compozy open`, `compozy session remove`, and the existing `compozy onboarding` command group.

##### Web UI remembers your active workspace

The web UI now remembers your active workspace across reloads and browser restarts, so a refresh no longer snaps you back to the first workspace. Direct and shared session links resolve a session's owning workspace from its ID and load reliably regardless of which workspace is selected, and the UI redirects to the agent page when an opened session belongs to a different workspace than the active one.
